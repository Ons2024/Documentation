#  User Equilibrium (UE) â€” Path Flow Formulation

## Overview

The **User Equilibrium (UE)** principle, introduced by *Wardrop (1952)*, states that:

> In equilibrium, no driver can reduce their travel cost by unilaterally changing routes.

In other words, all **used paths** between any originâ€“destination (OD) pair have **equal and minimal costs**, while **unused paths** have **equal or higher costs**.

This represents **selfish route choice behavior** â€” each user independently minimizes their own travel time or cost.

##  Mathematical Representation

At equilibrium, the **path-based UE condition** is expressed as:

$$
f_p^{r,z} \cdot (c_p^{r,z} - u_r^{z}) = 0
$$

where:  
- $f_p^{r,z}$ = flow on path $p$ for OD pair $r$ and user class $z$  
- $c_p^{r,z}$ = travel cost (or time) on path $p$  
- $u_r^{z}$ = minimum (shortest) cost between OD pair $(r,z)$  

**Interpretation:**
- If $f_p^{r,z} > 0$, then $c_p^{r,z} = u_r^{z}$ â†’ path is used and minimal.  
- If $c_p^{r,z} > u_r^{z}$, then $f_p^{r,z} = 0$ â†’ path is unused (costlier).

## Full Formulation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_p^{r,z} \cdot (c_p^{r,z} - u_r^{z}) = 0, && \forall p \in P_r, \forall (r,z) \\
& c_p^{r,z} - u_r^{z} \ge 0, && \forall p \in P_r, \forall (r,z) \\
& \sum_{p \in P_r} f_p^{r,z} = x_r^{z}, && \forall (r,z) \quad \text{(Flow conservation)} \\
& f_p^{r,z} \ge 0, \; c_p^{r,z} \ge 0, \; u_r^{z} \ge 0 && \text{(Nonnegativity constraints)}
\end{aligned}
$$

##  Path Cost Definition

Each path cost is the sum of its link costs:

$$
c_p^{r,z} = \sum_{e \in E} \Delta_{p,e}^{(r)} \, c_e^{z}
$$

where:  
- $\Delta_{p,e}^{(r)} = 1$ if link $e$ is on path $p$, else $0$.  
- $E$: set of all links.  

The minimum cost for OD pair $(r,z)$ is:

$$
u_r^{z} = \min_{p \in P_r} c_p^{r,z}
$$

---

##  Behavioral Interpretation

- At equilibrium: $c_p^{r,z} = u_r^{z}$ for all used paths.  
- For unused paths: $c_p^{r,z} > u_r^{z} \Rightarrow f_p^{r,z} = 0$.  

If the network is **not at equilibrium**, travelers will continue switching to cheaper paths until this condition is satisfied.

This reflects **rational, selfish driver behavior** under *Wardropâ€™s first principle*.

## ðŸ”— Relationship to Beckmannâ€™s Formulation

The **[[the Beckmann Problem]]** provides an equivalent *optimization-based representation* of this equilibrium:

$$
\min \sum_{a \in A} \int_0^{x_a} t_a(w)\, dw
$$

subject to:
- flow conservation,
- nonnegativity.

This problem is **convex**, and its optimality conditions are equivalent to the UE complementarity system above.
