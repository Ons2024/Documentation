 GNNs are generally constrained to a fixed graph size and 130 often require workarounds-such as transfer learning or padding with dummy nodes, to handle networks of different 131 sizes


# Abstract 

 - In this paper, we leverage the power of heterogeneous graph neural networks to propose an end-to-end surrogate model for traffic assignment, specifically user equilibrium traffic assignment problems.
