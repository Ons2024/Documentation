The paper addresses the **User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment Problem (UE-TAP)** ‚Äî determining how traffic distributes across a network when every traveler chooses the route that <font color="#c00000">minimizes their travel time</font>. Traditional iterative optimization algorithms for this task are **computationally expensive and inflexible**, especially for large or dynamic networks.

The authors propose a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based deep learning framework** to directly learn the mapping between **origin‚Äìdestination (OD) demands** and **equilibrium traffic flows**, <u><font color="#c00000">bypassing the need for iterative solvers</font></u>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">The UE traffic assignment problem (UE-TAP) can be formulated as a convex nonlinear program  and solved by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm</span>
However, owing to the classical method‚Äôs high complexity and limited efficiency, three main streams of solution algorithms have emerged: <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">link-based algorithms</span> , <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">bush-based methods</span> , and <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">path-based algorithms</span>. More recently,<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)"> parallel computing strategies</span> have been explored to enhance both efficiency and scalability in solving UE-TAP
There is also <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">data-driven deep learning methods</span> (based on ML and data-driven based)

they develop an end-to-end learning-based framework for user equilibrium prediction under variable network topologies

This study utilizes network partitioning and subgraph training, explicitly incorporating network attributes such as free-flow travel time and link capacity, and employing a variable adjacency matrix as input, thereby making the model adapt dynamically to varying network topologies and significantly improving model robustness.

The compute the optmization of the UE to use it in their model as ground truth cause real world data is hard to get.

The goal is to develop a model that can efficiently learn the mapping between OD demand and equilibrium traffic flows in the network, thereby reducing computational time while maintaining high accuracy
