they develop an end-to-end learning-based framework for user equilibrium prediction under variable network topologies

This study utilizes network partitioning and subgraph training, explicitly incorporating network attributes such as free-flow travel time and link capacity, and employing a variable adjacency matrix as input, thereby making the model adapt dynamically to varying network topologies and significantly improving model robustness.

The compute the optmization of the UE to use it in their model as ground truth cause real world data is hard to get.

The goal is to develop a model that can efficiently learn the mapping between OD demand and equilibrium traffic flows in the network, thereby reducing computational time while maintaining high accuracy

1. in case of a fixed network 
	The model starts with three main components:

	- **OD demand information** ‚Äî tells how many trips go from each origin to each destination.
	    
	- **Adjacency matrix (A)** ‚Äî tells which nodes are connected (the graph structure of the road network).
	    
	- **Edge attributes** ‚Äî physical link properties (capacity, free-flow time, etc.).

	![[Pasted image 20251018184811.png]]
	- GCN ‚Üí learns spatial dependencies between nodes (node embeddings).
	    
	- Node embeddings + link attributes ‚Üí form edge embeddings.
	    
	- Regression ‚Üí outputs equilibrium flow per link.
	

2. GCN for variable network topologies
	we introduce traffic network partitioning enabling our approach to be adaptable and transferable across different traffic networks.
	
	In the variable-topology model, the road network is first represented as a **dual graph**, where each road segment becomes a node and connections between consecutive roads form the edges. This allows the model to directly capture relationships between roads rather than intersections. To handle network variability, the network is then partitioned into subnetworks with equal numbers of edges, using zero-padding where necessary to maintain consistent input size. Because traffic demand is originally defined at the origin‚Äìdestination (OD) level, an **all-or-nothing assignment** is used to project this demand onto the road segments: for each OD pair, all trips are assigned to the shortest free-flow path, and link flows are aggregated across all OD pairs. These flows, combined with road attributes such as capacity and free-flow time, form the **edge-level feature vectors**. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) with an edge-based adjacency matrix processes these features to learn spatial dependencies among connected roads and predict the equilibrium traffic flow under variable network topologies.

The **User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment Problem (UE-TAP)** aims to estimate how traffic distributes across a road network when every driver chooses the route with the least travel time. Traditional optimization methods (like the **Frank‚ÄìWolfe algorithm**) can solve this but are **iterative, computationally heavy, and inflexible** for large or dynamic networks.

This study introduces a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based deep learning framework** to approximate user equilibrium flows **without iterative optimization**. The model directly maps **origin‚Äìdestination (OD) demand**, **link attributes**, and **network topology** to **equilibrium link flows**, achieving fast and accurate predictions.

For networks with a fixed topology:

- Inputs include the **OD demand matrix**, **adjacency matrix (A)**, and **link attributes** (capacity, free-flow time, etc.).
    
- The GCN captures **spatial relationships between nodes** to produce **node embeddings**.
    
- Since traffic flows occur on **edges (links)**, node embeddings are **concatenated and fused with link features** to form **edge embeddings**.
    
- A final **regression layer** predicts the **equilibrium flow** on each road segment.
    

This model achieves high prediction accuracy for static networks, demonstrating that deep learning can effectively approximate UE solutions.

To handle **networks with changing topologies** (e.g., link failures or new roads), the authors propose:

- **Traffic Network Partitioning:** The network is divided into **subgraphs** (subnetworks) with equal numbers of edges for standardized input size.
    
- **Dual Graph Representation:** Each **road segment becomes a node**, and adjacency is defined between connected road segments (edge-level connectivity).
    
- **All-or-Nothing Assignment:** OD demand is projected onto links by assigning all trips to their **shortest paths**, creating initial link-level demand features.
    
- These features (capacity, free-flow time, and projected demand) are then embedded and processed by a **GCN using the segment adjacency matrix**.
    

This model generalizes to new or partially altered networks and even supports **transfer learning** ‚Äî a pretrained model can be fine-tuned on another network with limited data.
