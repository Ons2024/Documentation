The paper addresses the **User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment Problem (UE-TAP)** â€” determining how traffic distributes across a network when every traveler chooses the route that <font color="#c00000">minimizes their travel time</font>. Traditional iterative optimization algorithms for this task are **computationally expensive and inflexible**, especially for large or dynamic networks.
