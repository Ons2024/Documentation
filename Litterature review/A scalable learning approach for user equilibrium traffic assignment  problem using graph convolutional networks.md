The paper addresses the **User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment Problem (UE-TAP)** — determining how traffic distributes across a network when every traveler chooses the route that <font color="#c00000">minimizes their travel time</font>. Traditional iterative optimization algorithms for this task are **computationally expensive and inflexible**, especially for large or dynamic networks.

The authors propose a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based deep learning framework** to directly learn the mapping between **origin–destination (OD) demands** and **equilibrium traffic flows**, <u><font color="#c00000">bypassing the need for iterative solvers</font></u>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">The UE traffic assignment problem (UE-TAP) can be formulated as a convex nonlinear program  and solved by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm</span>
