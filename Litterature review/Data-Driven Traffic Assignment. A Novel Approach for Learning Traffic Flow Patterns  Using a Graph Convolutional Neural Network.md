## Core Idea

This study introduces a **data-driven approach** to learn **traffic flow patterns** in transportation networks directly from data, ==without assuming user behavior models like user equilibrium or system optimal==.
The method reformulates the traditional **traffic assignment problem** as a **learning task**, using a **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)** to model how travel demand from various origins and destinations diffuses through network links.

## Problematic

The **Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP)** is central to transportation planning, traditionally solved using **User Equilibrium (UE)** models that assume perfect driver knowledge and rational route choices. However, these assumptions often fail in real-world, dynamic traffic conditions.

While **Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA)** models offer more realism, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for large-scale, real-time applications.


With the rise of **traffic sensors**, **connected vehicles**, and **big data**, there is growing potential for **data-driven approaches** to estimate and forecast traffic flows. Yet, most existing data-driven models only handle **short-term predictions** on small road segments and fail to capture **network-wide dynamics** or **travel demand variations**.

To address these gaps, this study introduces a **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)** framework that learns ***traffic flow patterns** directly from data*—without relying on behavioral assumptions. By representing transportation networks as graphs and modeling the **diffusion of origin-destination (OD) demand** through links.

In this work, they seek to answer the question:
> ==Can a deep learning model learn the flow patterns of a network without relying on the assumptions of user behavior for assigning traffic in the network?==


## DATA-DRIVEN TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT


- **Transportation network** is represented as a **weighted directed graph**.
- Each link between nodes carries information such as **distance, speed limit, capacity,** and **free-flow travel time**.
- The goal is to learn a **mapping function** that relates **origin-destination (OD) travel demands** to **link flows** in the network using available data and network characteristics (e.g., node locations, travel times).


### Transportation Network Model

The transportation network is modeled as a **weighted directed graph**:

$$
\mathcal{G}(v, \mathcal{E}, A_w)
$$

where:

- $v$: set of **nodes**
- $\mathcal{E}$: set of **links** $(i \rightarrow j)$
- $A_w$: **weighted adjacency matrix** based on free-flow travel time

#### Adjacency Weights

It anserws this question : “How long does it take to go from node _i_ to node _j_ when there’s no traffic (free-flow condition)?

- **$t^0$** denotes the free flow travel time between the origin and the destination nodes

---
#### Inputs

- **Origin-Destination (OD) demand matrices:**  
  $$
  [X_1, X_2, ..., X_m]
  $$

---
#### Outputs

- **Corresponding ==link flow== vectors:**  
  $$
  [F_1, F_2, ..., F_m]
  $$
---
#### Objective

Learn a **mapping function**:

$$
\mathcal{F}([X_1, X_2, ..., X_m]; \mathcal{G}(v, \mathcal{E}, A_w)) = [F_1, F_2, ..., F_m]
$$

=> that predicts **link flows** from **OD demands** and **network structure**.

The model captures **flow propagation** from origins to destinations within the network.

### Graph Convolution Neural Network for Flow Pattern Learning

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

    ##### **The main idea**
    
	Instead of looking at all the input data at once (like a regular neural network), a CNN looks at **small parts** (or **patches**) of the data using a **filter** (also called a **kernel**).
	
	These filters “slide” across the input and detect patterns such as:
		- Edges
		- Shapes
		- More complex features as the network gets deeper
		
	This operation is called **convolution**
