## Core Idea

This study introduces a **data-driven approach** to learn **traffic flow patterns** in transportation networks directly from data, ==without assuming user behavior models like user equilibrium or system optimal==.
The method reformulates the traditional **traffic assignment problem** as a **learning task**, using a **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)** to model how travel demand from various origins and destinations diffuses through network links.

## Problematic

The **Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP)** is central to transportation planning, traditionally solved using **User Equilibrium (UE)** models that assume perfect driver knowledge and rational route choices. However, these assumptions often fail in real-world, dynamic traffic conditions. While **Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA)** models offer more realism, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for large-scale, real-time applications.
