This study introduces a **data-driven approach** to learn **traffic flow patterns** in transportation networks directly from data, ==without assuming user behavior models like user equilibrium or system optimal==.
The method reformulates the traditional **traffic assignment problem** as a **learning task**, using a **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)** to model how travel demand from various origins and destinations diffuses through network links.
