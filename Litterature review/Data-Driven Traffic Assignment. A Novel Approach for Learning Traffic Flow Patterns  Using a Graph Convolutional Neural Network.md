## Core Idea

This study introduces a **data-driven approach** to learn **traffic flow patterns** in transportation networks directly from data, ==without assuming user behavior models like user equilibrium or system optimal==.
The method reformulates the traditional **traffic assignment problem** as a **learning task**, using a **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)** to model how travel demand from various origins and destinations diffuses through network links.

## Problematic

The **Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP)** is central to transportation planning, traditionally solved using **User Equilibrium (UE)** models that assume perfect driver knowledge and rational route choices. However, these assumptions often fail in real-world, dynamic traffic conditions.

While **Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA)** models offer more realism, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for large-scale, real-time applications.


With the rise of **traffic sensors**, **connected vehicles**, and **big data**, there is growing potential for **data-driven approaches** to estimate and forecast traffic flows. Yet, most existing data-driven models only handle **short-term predictions** on small road segments and fail to capture **network-wide dynamics** or **travel demand variations**.

To address these gaps, this study introduces a **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)** framework that learns ***traffic flow patterns** directly from data*—without relying on behavioral assumptions. By representing transportation networks as graphs and modeling the **diffusion of origin-destination (OD) demand** through links.

In this work, they seek to answer the question:
> ==Can a deep learning model learn the flow patterns of a network without relying on the assumptions of user behavior for assigning traffic in the network?==


## DATA-DRIVEN TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT


- **Transportation network** is represented as a **weighted directed graph**.
- Each link between nodes carries information such as **distance, speed limit, capacity,** and **free-flow travel time**.
- The goal is to learn a **mapping function** that relates **origin-destination (OD) travel demands** to **link flows** in the network using available data and network characteristics (e.g., node locations, travel times).


### Transportation Network Model

The transportation network is modeled as a **weighted directed graph**:

$$
\mathcal{G}(v, \mathcal{E}, A_w)
$$

where:

- $v$: set of **nodes**
- $\mathcal{E}$: set of **links** $(i \rightarrow j)$
- $A_w$: **weighted adjacency matrix** based on free-flow travel time

#### Adjacency Weights

It anserws this question : “How long does it take to go from node _i_ to node _j_ when there’s no traffic (free-flow condition)?
		![[Pasted image 20251018115741.png]]

- **$t^0$** denotes the free flow travel time between the origin and the destination nodes

---
#### Inputs

- **Origin-Destination (OD) demand matrices:**  
  $$
  [X_1, X_2, ..., X_m]
  $$

---
#### Outputs

- **Corresponding ==link flow== vectors:**  
  $$
  [F_1, F_2, ..., F_m]
  $$
---
#### Objective

Learn a **mapping function**:

$$
\mathcal{F}([X_1, X_2, ..., X_m]; \mathcal{G}(v, \mathcal{E}, A_w)) = [F_1, F_2, ..., F_m]
$$

=> that predicts **link flows** from **OD demands** and **network structure**.

The model captures **flow propagation** from origins to destinations within the network.

### Graph Convolution Neural Network for Flow Pattern Learning

==CNNs treat the network as an image → fail to capture actual **traffic flow relationships** among nodes and links.==

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

	##### **The main idea**
	    
	Instead of looking at all the input data at once (like a regular neural network), a CNN looks at **small parts** (or **patches**) of the data using a **filter** (also called a **kernel**).
		
	These filters “slide” across the input and detect patterns such as:
	- Edges
	- Shapes
	- More complex features as the network gets deeper
			
	This operation is called **convolution**
	
	---
	
	### **CNN architecture — step by step**
	
	#### **(a) Input Layer**
	
	- Example: an image of size 28×28 pixels (like grayscale handwriting).
	    
	
	#### **(b) Convolution Layer**
	
	- Applies **filters** (like small 3×3 or 5×5 grids).
	    
	- Each filter extracts specific **spatial features** (like edges or corners).
	    
	- Output: a new set of “feature maps” that highlight important parts of the image.
	    
	
	#### **(c) Activation Function**
	
	- Usually **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): keeps positive signals, removes negatives.
	    
	- Adds **non-linearity** — helps model complex relationships.
	    
	
	#### **(d) Pooling Layer**
	
	- Reduces the size of the data (by taking averages or maximum values).
	    
	- Helps the network **focus on the most important features** and speeds up training.
	    
	
	#### **(e) Fully Connected (Dense) Layer**
	
	- Combines all extracted features to make a **final prediction** — e.g.,  
	“This is a car” 🚗 or “This is a cat” 🐱.
	
	---
	 **Limitation**
	CNNs work great on grids (like images) but not on networks (graphs), because:  
	Roads and intersections are irregularly connected — not arranged in neat rows and columns.  
	So, a standard CNN can’t properly capture how traffic flows through complex road networks.

2. **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)**

    The GCNN replaces the image-based convolution with **graph convolution**
     *Remember*
     - Each node updates its state by **aggregating information from connected nodes**.
	- This is often called **“message passing.”**
	- Over several layers, each node learns not just its own features, but also what’s happening nearby.
	- The **adjacency matrix (Aw)** tells the model **which nodes are connected** and **how strongly** (e.g., distance, travel time, road capacity).
	- Graph convolution uses this to **control how information flows** through the network — mimicking real traffic propagation.

3.  **Modele Architecture**


	- The GCNN learns **how traffic (flow)** diffuses from **origin nodes to destination nodes** by using **graph convolution**, which considers the network’s **structure** (node positions, connections, and link attributes).
	
	- The model captures **how flows on one link are influenced by adjacent links**, effectively modeling **traffic propagation** within the network.
	
	- Each node and link are embedded with information (features), and the GCNN jointly learns these **features and relationships**.
	
	- Once the GCNN has learned the **flow diffusion patterns**, the learned representations are passed into a **feed-forward neural network** to estimate the **link traffic flows**.
	
	![[Pasted image 20251018124333.png]]
	
	**Layer 1:** Learns how demand spreads between nodes (network structure).  
	**Layer 2:** Learns how that demand turns into flows along links.  
	**Layer 3:** Aggregates all flows per link to get final traffic flow estimates.
	 - **Θ**, **Wq**, and **WF** are all **trainable weights**,  
	- while the **graph convolution filter structure gθg_θgθ​** and the **adjacency matrix (Aw)** come from the **network topology** (they are fixed, not learned).
	
	####### **The main idea: Graph-based Flow Modeling**
	
	✔️ They start with the **OD demand matrix** ($X$) and the **adjacency matrix** ($A_w$) that encodes how nodes are connected.  
	✔️ They apply a **graph convolution filter** ($g_\theta$) to model how demand spreads across connected nodes.  
	✔️ The parameters **θ** (Theta) are **learnable** — the model adjusts them to best fit observed flow data.  
	✔️ They use a **nonlinear activation function** $f_1$ (tanh) to capture complex relationships after the convolution.  
	✔️ The output of that first step ($H_1$) goes into the **second layer**, which uses learnable parameters $W_q$ and another activation $f_2$ (tanh).  
	✔️ This second layer learns how **demand from each node turns into flows on adjacent links**, giving $q$ (the distributed link flow matrix).  
	✔️ Then $q$ is **transposed** ($q^T$) and passed into the **third layer**, which uses $W_F$ and a **linear activation** $f_3$ to produce final **link flows** ($F$).

4. **Diffusion Process**

	- Since OD and adjacency matrices **don’t contain path information**, the model uses a **diffusion process** to approximate how flows travel through the network.
	
	- This process is modeled as a **random walk** over the network graph, allowing the model to capture multi-hop connections (i.e., how demand moves across several links).
	
	- It ensures the GCNN can learn **realistic path-like flow distributions** without explicitly defining paths or user behavior
	
	- Uses a **graph convolution filter (g_θ)** derived from the **diffusion process** to model how demand spreads from origins to destinations.
    
	- Learns network properties and flow diffusion patterns.
	
	- Output: **H₁**, a “convoluted” demand matrix representing how demand diffuses across nodes.
	- So expensive for large networks
	- ==**the diffusion process mimics the _probabilistic spreading of flows_ across paths like in SUE** but it does **not explicitly model traveler behavior or equilibrium conditions**.==

####### **Diffusion Learning in GCNN**

- Multi-step diffusion is **computationally expensive** → instead, they learn the overall diffusion using one parameter matrix **Θ**.  
- **Θ** acts as a **routing matrix**, showing the probability that flow from node *i* reaches node *j*.  
- The **diffusion convolution** combines **Θ**, the network structure $(\bar{D}_w^{-1} \bar{A}_w)$, and **OD demand** $(X)$ to learn how demand spreads through the network.

---

####### **Two Versions of the Diffusion Process**

- **Random walk** → Eq. (11):  
  $$
  g_\theta * X = \Theta (\bar{D}_w^{-1} \bar{A}_w) X
  $$
  
- **Laplacian** → Eq. (14):  
  $$
  g_\theta * X = \Theta (I - \bar{D}_w^{-1} \bar{A}_w) X
  $$

---

During training, **Θ** is learned to **approximate the stationary (steady-state) flow distribution**,  
avoiding explicit behavioral models or multiple sequential diffusion steps.

The proposed model uses a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) to learn how travel demand spreads across a transportation network. The inputs are the Origin–Destination (OD) demand matrix, representing trips between nodes, and the adjacency matrix, representing network connectivity. However, these inputs alone cannot describe how flows actually propagate through intermediate links and paths. To address this, the authors introduce a **flow diffusion process**, inspired by stochastic user equilibrium, where traffic flow is modeled as a probabilistic diffusion (or random walk) from origin to destination nodes. Initially, they consider a multi-step diffusion model, where each step of the diffusion has its own learnable parameter, but this becomes computationally expensive for large networks. Therefore, they propose an alternative approach that learns the **stationary diffusion process directly**, using a single learnable parameter matrix ΘΘΘ. This matrix captures the probability that flow moves between nodes, effectively serving as a learned routing matrix. The diffusion process is modeled either through a random walk transition matrix or using a Laplacian matrix formulation, both of which represent the structural properties of the network. During training, the GCNN learns the parameters ΘΘΘ to approximate how OD demand diffuses through the network, enabling the model to infer link-level flow distributions without relying on explicit behavioral models or iterative equilibrium computations.

### DATA GENERATION

Because real-world, high-resolution OD and flow data are scarce, the authors generated **synthetic training data** using the **User Equilibrium (UE)** framework solved with the **Frank–Wolfe algorithm**. They used two benchmark transportation networks (Sioux Falls and East Massachusetts) and created 5,000 random OD matrices per traffic condition by scaling the base OD matrix with random factors. For each OD scenario, UE solutions provided the corresponding link flows, serving as ground truth for training and testing. This process allowed them to evaluate how well the proposed GCNN model can learn to approximate equilibrium-like traffic flow distributions under uncongested, moderate, and congested conditions.

> ==We use the UE based traffic assignment mainly to generate the data to verify our approach.==


### RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
hey compared **three diffusion methods**:

1. **Random Walk** (Diffusion convolution using transition matrix)
    
2. **Laplacian Graph** (Diffusion convolution using normalized Laplacian)
    
3. **Spectral Graph** (Spectral GCN — eigen-decomposition of adjacency matrix)
    

Across **two networks** (Sioux Falls and East Massachusetts) and **three traffic conditions** (uncongested, moderate, congested).

the model achieved near-perfect accuracy (R² ≈ 1) with minimal RMSE and MAE. Both diffusion-based (random walk and Laplacian) and spectral graph convolutions performed similarly, confirming that the network effectively captures flow diffusion dynamics without explicit behavioral modeling.
